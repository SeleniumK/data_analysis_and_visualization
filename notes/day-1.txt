Descriptive statistics
-----------------------

-- Arithmetic Mean
	(for our purposes, mean == average)
	sum of data, divided by number of data points
	very sensitive to outliers
	where data is clustered

-- Median
	Literal Midpoint of data
	insensitive to outliers
	if dataset has even number, average two middle nums

-- Mode
	most common value in data set
	collections package makes this super easy (Counter object, works like a dictionary: key=thing counted, value=number of counts)

-- Standard Deviation
	how data is clustered, and how spread out it is
	how far is data spread from it's mean
	larger standard deviation == larger spread

	need mean first.
	what i the distance from the mean
	what is the total distance from the mean across my data set
	what is my average distance from the mean across the data set
	get units right and reduce down from squared distance

	measures the variability

	std small compared to mean == tightly spread

-- Quantiles
	Percentile
	if you step this far into the data set, what is the value? (25% in? 50% in?)
	used to tell the spread while not worrying about outliers

	Interquartile range
	q75 - q25

	spread of the middle of the data




Numpy

NP Arrays
	cannot change datatype, or make larger, but can change values
