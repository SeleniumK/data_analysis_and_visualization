Pandas

Series
	like numpy array, fixed size

DataFrame
	Data organized as columns and rows (can convert from dictionary)
	All data within column needs to be the same type, but not all data in the dataframe neets to be the same
	Rows are auto incremented integers by default
	Columns are pandas series objects

	Can access columns with dot or square bracket location
	can access multiple columns df["one thing", "second thing"]

	access rows with .loc[idx]
	can slice on rows -- .loc[0:4]
	list of rows: .loc[[0, 2, 4]]

	setting a new index:
		.set_index("column you want to set as index")
		doesn't mutate the dataframe, just returns a new dataframe
		set inplace=True will mutate it


	NOT IMMUTABLE OBJECTS
